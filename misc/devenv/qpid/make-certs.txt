make-cert.sh generates cert databases to be deployed to /etc/qpid/pki/

With no params it generates certs for "localhost.localdomain".  Whatever host
you're generating certs for it's important to match whatever is listed in the
/etc/qpidd.conf file.  The "ssl-cert-name" must match or this will fail.

Using Mostly Defaults
---------------------
To generate a cert for ex-qpid1.stg.rhcloud.com run:

./make-cert.sh -O ex-qpid1.stg.rhcloud.com -s ex-qpid1.stg.rhcloud.com

This will, by default, create certs that are valid for 3 months.

Specifying Certificate Expiration
---------------------------------
To generate a cert that is valid for a longer time run:

./make-cert.sh -m 12 -O ex-qpid1.stg.rhcloud.com -s ex-qpid1.stg.rhcloud.com

This will generate a cert that is valid for 1 year.

Specifying Certificate Password
-------------------------------
To generate a cert that has a specific password (needed for PROD), run:

./make-cert.sh -P mypass -O ex-qpid1.stg.rhcloud.com -s ex-qpid1.stg.rhcloud.com


Once make-cert.sh is done generating the new cert, copy the test/server_db and
test/client_db to /etc/qpid/pki of the hosts. The client hosts need the client_db
and the servers need the server_db.  Then restart qpidd.


Troubleshooting
---------------
*IMPORTANT*  If you see an error like this on the qpid server in /var/log/messages:

Jul 18 22:09:29 qpid1 qpidd[1977]: 2011-07-18 22:09:29 error Error reading socket: NSS error [-12195]

it may mean the server is working fine but a client with an old ssl cert is trying to
connect.  Please log in to all the clients and ensure they've been restarted.  Some
old clients may be in a funky state and need to be kill -9'd.  (Nagios has been known
to do this in staging)
