        What's Flex?

    #flex-ways
      OpenShift Flex manages the resources offered by Amazon Web Services (and others coming soon). There's two ways to get started:

      %ol
        %li
          %p 
            Provide your Amazon EC2 credentials in order to authorize OpenShift Flex to deploy cloud servers on your behalf.
        
        %em OR

        %li#free-flex
          %p#offer
            Take advantage of Red Hat's free trial offer. The free trial includes 30 days or 30 hours (whichever comes first) of free cloud resources from Amazon EC2.

          %p.terms
            The free trial is governed by the terms and conditions agreed to during the registration process for OpenShift.
          
          %p.terms
            Please Remember:
          
          %ul.terms     
            
          
            %li
              OpenShift is in developer preview with no service level agreements.

            %li
              OpenShift should not be used for production purposes.
  
            %li
              At Red Hat's discretion, it may decommission the resources it granted as part of the free trial without notification, explanation, or backup.

            %li
              Users of OpenShift Flex are responsible for making backups of all their data

            %li
              After the expiration of the free trial, the resources and data on them will be deleted

            %li
              To maximize the time of your free trial we recommend that you stop your cluster when not utilizing it
